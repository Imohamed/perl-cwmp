perl-cwmp - Perl ACS server implementing CWMP protocol to manage CPE clients

Idea here is to implement simpliest possible TR-069 server which can talk to vendor's
CPE and support various quriks (mostly protocol violations) found in implementations.


This implementation follows specification:

CPE WAN Management Protocol v1.1 
TR-069 Issue 1 Amendment 2

http://www.broadband-forum.org/technical/download/TR-069_Amendment-2.pdf


Currently implemented:

+ 3.4.1 Encoding SOAP over HTTP
+ 3.4.2 Transaction Sessions
- 3.4.3 File Transfers
- 3.4.4 Authentication
- 3.4.5 Digest Authentication
+ 3.4.6 Additional HTTP Requirements
